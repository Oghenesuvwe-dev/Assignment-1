CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS: 
Public, Private, and Hybrid.
Cloud computing has improved the way businesses operate, offering scalable, flexible, and cost-effective IT solutions. 
A fundamental aspect of cloud computing is the deployment model, which determines how cloud resources are provisioned and managed. 
There are three primary models: Public, Private, and Hybrid.


1, PUBLIC CLOUD.
A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is shared by multiple organisations. 
It is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider (CSP), such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. 
Public clouds offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, making them attractive for businesses of all sizes.
Use Cases:
1, Startups and Small Businesses: Public clouds provide a cost-effective way to get started without significant upfront investments in hardware or infrastructure.
2, Large Enterprises: Public clouds can be used to scale applications rapidly, handle peak workloads, and test new initiatives.
3, Non-Profit Organisations: Public clouds can offer affordable and scalable solutions for mission-critical applications.
4, Developers and Innovators: Public clouds provide a vast ecosystem of tools and services for developing and deploying applications.


2, PRIVATE CLOUD.
A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is dedicated to a single organisation. It can be hosted on-premises or in a data centre owned by the organisation, or it can be hosted by a third-party provider. Private clouds offer greater control and security, but they can be more expensive to maintain and scale.
Use Cases:
1, Highly Regulated Industries: Industries such as healthcare, finance, and government often have strict compliance requirements that necessitate a private cloudâ€¦ fintech 
2, Large Enterprises: Organisations with sensitive data or unique requirements may prefer a private cloud to maintain control over their infrastructure.
3, Hybrid Environments: Private clouds can be used as part of a hybrid cloud strategy to complement public cloud services where Nutanix and Azure Cloud are good examples.


HYBRID CLOUD.
A hybrid cloud combines elements of public and private clouds, allowing organisations to leverage the benefits of both.
This model enables organisations to migrate certain workloads to the public cloud while retaining control over sensitive or mission-critical applications on-premises.

USE CASES:
1, Bursting to the Cloud: Organisations can use public cloud resources to handle peak workloads or seasonal demand.
2, Disaster Recovery: A hybrid cloud can provide a reliable backup and disaster recovery solution.
3, Application Migration: Organisations can gradually migrate existing applications to the cloud without disrupting their operations.
4, Data Centre Consolidation: Hybrid clouds can help consolidate data centres and reduce IT costs.


USE CASES:
Startups and Small Businesses: 
Public clouds provide a cost-effective way to get started without significant upfront investments in hardware or infrastructure. 
They allow startups to scale their operations as needed without the need for large capital expenditures.

Large Enterprises: 
Public clouds can be used to scale applications rapidly, handle peak workloads, and test new initiatives. 
For example, a large retail company can use a public cloud to handle increased demand during the holiday season.

Non-Profit Organizations:
Public clouds can offer affordable and scalable solutions for mission-critical applications. 
Non-profit organizations can leverage public clouds to reduce their IT costs and focus on their core mission.

Developers and Innovators: 
Public clouds provide a vast ecosystem of tools and services for developing and deploying applications.
Developers can easily access a wide range of resources, such as databases, analytics tools, and machine learning frameworks, to build and deploy their applications.


CHOOSING THE RIGHT DEPLOYMENT MODEL.
The best deployment model for an organisation depends on various factors, including:
1, Security requirements: If data security is a top priority, a private or hybrid cloud may be more suitable.
2, Compliance requirements: Certain industries or regulations may mandate specific deployment models.
3, Scalability needs: Public clouds offer excellent scalability, while private clouds may require more upfront planning.
4, Budget: Public clouds can be more cost-effective in the long run, but private clouds may have lower upfront costs.
5, Technical expertise: Organisations with limited IT resources may find public clouds easier to manage.
